/**
 * @brief Settings to define the color order.
 * Each entry is defined by 4 numbers in the octal system and
 * defines in which order the color-values are sent to the strip.
 * Also the number defines if the strip has a white led. 
 * 
 * The default ordering for the numbers is: White, Red, Green, Blue.
 * 
 * For an example we use a strip which requires the values in the order
 * BRWG. The BRWG value is defined by the octal number 2130. To get the
 * offsets for the colors we need to split the number into its digits (still octal).
 * B R W G
 * 2 1 3 0
 * 
 * If the R value is equal to the W value, the strip has no white led.
 * As this is not the case in our example, the strip has a white led.
 * 
 * For the implementation we need an array which holds the values for
 * pixel. As each pixel consists of 4 LEDs and each LED requires one byte
 * storage (0 - 255), we need 4 bytes for each pixel.
 * The values for the pixels are stored in an uint8_t array.
 * Lets assume we have 2 pixels which should light up in the colors
 * red and green. The array we need to send to the strip looks like this:
 * 
 *               |        Pixel 0            |       Pixel 1             |
 * Color(offset) | B(0) | R(1) | W(2) | G(3) | B(0) | R(1) | W(2) | G(3) |
 * Value         [ 0x00 , 0xff , 0x00 , 0xff , 0x00 , 0xff , 0x00 , 0xff ]
 *                  ï¿ª
 *            uint8_t* pixels
 * The pixels array is defined as uint8_t* pixels. The first pixel colors 
 * are defined in the first four bytes. To access the bytes you can use 
 * the pixels pointer and add the offset of the color you want to access.
 * Remind that the offset resulted from the color order.
